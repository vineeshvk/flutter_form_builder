Flutter Form Builder provides an easy way of working with forms in Flutter by removing the boilerplate needed to build a form, validate fields, react to changes, and collect final user input.

FormBuilder helps in creation of data collection forms in Flutter by removing the boilerplate needed to build a form, validate fields, react to changes,
and collect final user input.
It provides APIs to manage your Form and generating a FormBuilder compliant FormField. It is required by `form_builder_extra_fields` packages.
This package also contains common ready-made form input fields. The package gives you a convenient way of adding fields instead of creating your own FormBuilderField from scratch.

Form Builder Fields provides ready-made form input fields. Just like the flutter_form_builder package, it gives you a convenient way of adding fields instead of creating your own FormBuilderField from scratch.

Unlike flutter_form_builder package which depends purely on Flutter provided input fields, flutter_extra_fields depends on external libraries to provide input widgets and extends them to be FormBuilderFields.

Form Builder Validators provide a convenient way of validating data entered into any Flutter FormField. It provides common validation rules out of box (such as required, email, number, min, max, minLength, maxLength, date validations) as well as a way to compose multiple validation rules into one FormFieldValidator.

Also included is the `l10n` / `i18n` of error text messages into multiple languages
